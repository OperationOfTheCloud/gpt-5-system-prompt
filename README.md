This repository contains the full system prompt an AI model, identifying itself as "GPT-5", disclosed when directly asked. This is **not a third-party leak** but rather a self-disclosure by the model itself, obtained via prompt injection.

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate community analysis, reverse-engineering, and discussion of the model's purported core instructions.
